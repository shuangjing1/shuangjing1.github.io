        <p>For some, the Massachusetts federal district court R.I.S.E. Program has been a successful alternative to imprisonment and a path to rehabilitation, but restorative justice has a long way to go before becoming a large-scale solution to the problem of mass incarceration. Resources are limited, data is sparse and few get chances to participate. Yet, advocates remain hopeful as they confront a criminal justice system that is badly broken.</p>

            <h2 class="subheadline">The U.S. prison population is ballooning, yet victims of crime feel less safe</h2>
                <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom non-violent drug offenses to homicides, the United States justice system has one broad tool to address crime: incarceration. Due in part to the war on drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing, the U.S. prison population has <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/research/">increased</a> 500% over the past 40 years. There are now 2 million people in U.S. prisons and jails, according to The Sentencing Project, an American organization advocating for humane responses to crime, and it is widely known that Black people are disproportionately affected.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. accounts for just 5% of the global population, but more than 20% of the world’s prison population, according to the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/mass-incarceration">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, a nonprofit organization. Yet, surveys show that fear of crime continues to increase, even as more people are locked up. If the aim of the criminal justice system is to make people feel safer, it may not be working.</p>
                    <p>Even victims of crime aren’t satisfied with incarceration as a tool to address the harms done to them. Between 2006 and 2019, according to the <a herf="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>, 52% of all violent victimizations were left unreported to the police. Of those, 34% were because the victims dealt with the crime in another way, such as reporting it to another official, which shows distrust in the consequences of the existing police system.</p>
                    <p>“If you think about the way our criminal legal system currently works, there is little to no room within the structure of a court case for the victims,” said Susan Maze-Rothstein, the co-director of the Center for Restorative Justice at Suffolk University. “They are relegated to the role of witness. And so, arguably, what we are doing currently is more retraumatizing because people are left with their harm and their pain.”</p>

            <h2 class="subheadline">Restorative justice is attempting to shift the paradigm toward accountability</h2>
                <p><span class="dropcap">C</span>riminal justice systems are defined by the questions they ask. In the U.S., those questions often include, ‘What laws have been broken?’, ‘Who did it?’ and ‘What do the offenders deserve?’ According to some advocates, restorative justice reckons with the problems within the criminal justice system by asking different questions. These questions focus on healing for victims as well as accountability by the people who commit crimes, allowing them to face the harm they caused and take action to remedy what may have contributed to their actions in the first place.</p>
                <p>““We are in a place right now where our system is very punitive and has very high sentences,” said Adriaan Laani, the Touroff-Glueck Professor of Law at Harvard University. “ That has created an expectation among people that the only way to take harm seriously is to have a very high sentence …. You have to get over this assumption that people have that a restorative process is somehow not taking it seriously. Restorative justice can really get at true accountability in a way that the regular criminal process of incarceration does not.”</p>

                <p class="graph">Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-will-award-57-million-support-justice-system-reforms-and-racial-equity">announced</a> it would award almost $57 million to support criminal justice reform and advance racial equity within the criminal justice system. From that budget, $8 million specifically went toward promoting restorative justice systems among other similar causes. Throughout the years, there have also been several <a href="https://nacrj.org">gatherings</a> of experts in this growing field, such as the biennial National Conference on Restorative Justice by The National Association of Community and Restorative Justice.</p>
                <p class="graph">More prominently, however, restorative justice is being implemented at the state level. A 2020 analysis by Thalia González, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco, identified 264 statutes on restorative justice — including laws, court rules and regulations — spread across 46 jurisdictions in the U.S. However, as González wrote, “the vast majority of restorative justice laws are highly localized with significant discretion in decision-making,” which undercuts their effectiveness.</p>

                <h2 class="subheadline">Restorative justice faces growing pains. Concerns of equity, equal access, and racial discrimination still exist. </h2>
                <p class="graph"><span class="dropcap">“T</span>here’s a huge issue of equal access to restorative justice and equity in particular,” said Laani. “One [question] is whether or not all communities should have access to restorative justice. Ideally, you don’t want a kind of discretionary system where it’s just up in the air, but you want to have a very clear criteria for when people are given the option of taking a restorative process either as a form of diversion or as a form of reducing a criminal penalty.”</p>

                    <p>This lack of uniformity across states increases the likelihood for discrimination during the decision-making process and is one of the biggest barriers to engaging in restorative justice. Restorative justice programs also face <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/01/woke-democrat-tiffany-caban-wants-to-make-crime-victims-help-their-attackers/">pushback</a> from various government and law enforcement officials, whilst also dealing with several logistical challenges. At the moment, these programs are rare and only accessible to a tiny fraction of people who are incarcerated. On top of that, González also said that restorative justice can’t fix all the problems of the carceral state.</p>
                
                    <p>“In the U.S., our attachment to a racial capitalist society has been adherent to incarcerating Black and Brown folks for centuries,” said González. “This isn't new business. Restorative justice isn't going to solve that.”</p>
                </section>

                <section class="graf-box">
                    <h2 class="subheadline">How can restorative justice exist outside of the criminal justice system? </h2>
                    <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n considering the existing imperfections of restorative justice, many advocates see more promise in implementing restorative justice efforts upstream of incarceration, such as in schools.</p>

                    <p>“It is in that building of community, maintaining and sustaining community with these practices that you’re actually creating justice,” said Maze-Rothstein. “So, bringing in restorative justice only when things are going wrong is actually a very shallow way of bringing in these practices.”</p>

                    <p>González agreed. “[Restorative justice] is just one intervention and it depends on where the intervention happens. If it's much more upstream like in schools, then I think we have a better chance of addressing mass incarceration in the prison industrial complex.”</p>

                    <p>Howard Zehr, an early practitioner and pioneering advocate of restorative justice, said when he began his work in the late 1970s, restorative justice was used to address problems in the criminal legal system. As the movement has grown, however, Zehr said that restorative justice has been applied in several contexts outside the legal system.</p>

                    <p>For example, the Smithsonian Museum of American History uses a restorative framework to address the historical harms committed by museums. South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission centered its work around restorative principles. In the U.S., several schools use restorative justice to keep students out of the legal system.</p> 

                    <p>Restorative justice was never originally linked to crime. Modern-day restorative justice practices have their roots in indigenous systems, including Māori and Navajo traditions. Through a process which some tribes called “peacemaking,” Native American communities often worked through disputes by focusing on repairing relationships and finding solutions instead of placing blame and dishing punishment. Consequently, many experts believe these values are so strong that they support all facets of community, not just when a crime has been committed. </p>

                    <p>“If you go back to the 1950s, [restorative justice] ... was only cited in the criminal legal context, and it was only about harm reduction and diversion. That's a pretty narrow slice of opportunity,” said González. “But that's not what 2023 looks like, right? The diversity and flexibility of what a restorative framework is just so fundamentally different. And it's part of conversations like reparations and transitional justice … So it's just not that one tiny slice … How are we investing in communities at the front end so that we're diminishing those social legal pathways into mass incarceration, into the prison industrial complex?”</p>

                    <p>The tension between various advocates of restorative justice seems to lie with the importance they place on structural versus person-to-person remedies. That said, they are able to find common ground by agreeing the current system doesn’t work.</p>

                <section class="graf-box">
                    <h2 class="subheadline">Despite concerns, advocates of restorative justice in the United States remain optimistic.</h2>
                    <p><span class="dropcap">R</span>estorative justice has spread increasingly over recent decades, but advocates like González recognize that the field still has a long way to go toward having the systemic impact many want to see. Today, advocates grapple with a tension inherent to every social movement: operating within the existing system while pushing for a new and reimagined future.</p>
                    <p>“There's something that's really important about simultaneously acknowledging that we are in the arc of social work and social justice work and that there are acute circumstances on the ground,” said González. “I'm an abolitionist, but I also know that tomorrow a young person is going to stand up in court. If they could have a restorative option as opposed to not, I want that option to be available. So, it's about a continuum.”</p>
                    <p>But getting widespread support for restorative justice is still a large roadblock for the movement. Underlying the difficult adaptation of restorative justice practices into the broader criminal justice system is what Pointer calls a “public imagination problem.”</p>
                    <p>“That is the hurdle [that] we need to get over in terms of just expanding what that word justice can mean for people,” said Pointer. “So, can justice mean understanding impact and repairing harm? Can justice mean transforming the structural and equity characteristics that led to the need that fueled the behavior that caused harm in the first place? Once we're past that hurdle, once that public imagination is expanded, then I think we would be able to do something like what New Zealand, for example, has done, where restorative justice is a default option.”</p>
                    <p>When Pointer introduces people to restorative justice, they can be quick to dismiss it as a utopian idea. “I get that,” Pointer said. “But I just try to help people see [the] common human need, [the] common human experience in the wake of crime. And then it's less utopian, it's less idealistic about people and it's more just actually responsive to the needs [of the harmed party].” Expanding that public imagination is a slow process, advocates say. But, the growth of restorative justice in recent years has demonstrated it as a possibility, one advocates are pushing for everyday.</p>
