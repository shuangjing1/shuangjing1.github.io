                    <h2 class="subheadline">Barriers remain, but advocates are <span style="color:#CD395B">optimistic</span></h2>
                    <p><span class="dropcap">G</span>Garnering widespread support for restorative justice is still elusive. Underlying its difficult adaptation into the broader criminal justice system is what Pointer calls a “public imagination problem.”</p>

                    <p>“That is the hurdle [that] we need to get over, in terms of just expanding what that word ‘justice’ can mean for people,” says Pointer. “So, can ‘justice’ mean understanding impact and repairing harm? Can ‘justice’ mean transforming the structural and equity characteristics that led to the need that fueled the behavior that caused harm in the first place? Once we're past that hurdle, once that public imagination is expanded, then I think we would be able to do something like what New Zealand, for example, has done, where restorative justice is a default option.”</p>

                    <p>New Zealand has one of the most <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1177083X.2019.1678492">comprehensive</a> national restorative justice systems in the world, with formal efforts that <a herf="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/restorative-justice-new-zealand-best-practice">started</a> in 1989. But even their framework is not fully incorporated into the justice system. Experts like González and Zehr agree that outlining what a national restorative justice system could look like is a significant barrier for the movement.</p>

                    <p>When Pointer introduces restorative justice to people, she says they are quick to dismiss it as a utopian idea. “I get that,” she says. “But I just try to help people see [the] common human need, [the] common human experience in the wake of crime. And then it's less utopian, it's less idealistic about people and it's more just actually responsive to the needs [of the harmed party].” </p>

                    <p>Building and expanding that public imagination is a slow process. But the growth of restorative justice in recent years demonstrates that widespread implementation could be a possibility.</p> 

                    <p>As Maze-Rothstein says, “There is no human activity that could not benefit from these practices.”</p>
